# user-task-completion-likelihood
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a user will complete an online course based on engagement patterns. It uses a classification approach with a Decision Tree model.

## Dataset
The dataset contains user activity features such as:
TimeSpentOnCourse
NumberOfVideosWatched
NumberOfQuizzesTaken
CompletionRate
DeviceType
CourseCompletion (Target Variable: 1 = Completed, 0 = Not Completed)
